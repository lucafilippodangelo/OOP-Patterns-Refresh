# Patterns Refresh

Real reason why I'm implementing this is to remember that **patterns are not just for interviews**!

This project to refresh a set of probable working solutions for particular problems.
Design pattern shows you the best possible way to solve the recurring problem.

## Creational Patterns 
Creation of objects and classes

### Abstract Factory
**Abstract Factory**,	Creates an instance of several families of classes

### Builder
**Builder**, Separates object construction from its representation

### Factory Method
**Factory Method**, Creates an instance of several derived classes

### Prototype
**Prototype**, A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned

### Singleton
**Singleton**, A class of which only a single instance can exist

## Structural Patterns
Class and Object Composition

### Adapter
**Adapter**,	Match interfaces of different classes

### Bridge
**Bridge**,	Separates an object’s interface from its implementation

### Composite
**Composite**, A tree structure of simple and composite objects

### Decorator
**Decorator**, Add responsibilities to objects dynamically

### Facade
**Facade**, A single class that represents an entire subsystem

### Flyweight
**Flyweight**, A fine-grained instance used for efficient sharing

### Proxy
**Proxy**, An object representing another object

## Behavioral Patterns
Communication between class and objects

### Chain of Responsability
**Chain of Responsability**, A way of passing a request between a chain of objects

### Command
**Command**, Encapsulate a command request as an object

### Interpreter
**Interpreter**, A way to include language elements in a program

### Iterator
**Iterator**,	Sequentially access the elements of a collection

### Mediator
**Mediator**,	Defines simplified communication between classes

### Memento
**Memento**, Capture and restore an object's internal state

### Observer
**Observer**,	A way of notifying change to a number of classes

### State
**State**, Alter an object's behavior when its state changes

### Strategy
**Strategy**,	Encapsulates an algorithm inside a class

### Template Method
**Template Method**, Method	Defer the exact steps of an algorithm to a subclass

### Visitor
**Visitor**, Defines a new operation to a class without change
