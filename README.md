# Patterns Refresh
Real reason why I'm implementing this is to remember that patterns are not just for interviews!

This project to refresh a set of probable working solutions for particular recurring problems.

**Note** Download the full solution and search by labels as "//LD_MEDIATOR_002" to match description and code.

## CREATIONAL PATTERNS - Creation of Objects and Classes

## STRUCTURAL PATTERNS - Class and Object Composition

### -> Structural - Bridge
Separates an object’s interface from its implementation

### -> Structural - Composite
A tree structure of simple and composite objects

### -> Structural - Decorator
Add responsibilities to objects dynamically

### -> Structural - Facade
A single class that represents an entire subsystem

### -> Structural - Flyweight
A fine-grained instance used for efficient sharing

### -> Structural - Proxy
An object representing another object

## BEHAVIORAL PATTERNS - Communication between class and objects

### -> Behavioral- Chain of Responsability
A way of passing a request between a chain of objects

### -> Behavioral- Command
Encapsulate a command request as an object

### -> Behavioral- Interpreter
A way to include language elements in a program

### -> Behavioral- Iterator
Sequentially access the elements of a collection

### -> Behavioral- Memento
Capture and restore an object's internal state

### -> Behavioral- Observer
A way of notifying change to a number of classes

### -> Behavioral- State
Alter an object's behavior when its state changes

### -> Behavioral- Strategy
Encapsulates an algorithm inside a class

### -> Behavioral- Template Method
Method	Defer the exact steps of an algorithm to a subclass

### -> Behavioral- Visitor
Defines a new operation to a class without change
