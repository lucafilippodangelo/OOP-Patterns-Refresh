# Patterns Refresh

Real reason why I'm implementing this is to remember that patterns are not just for interviews!

This project to refresh a set of probable working solutions for particular problems.
Design pattern shows you the best possible way to solve the recurring problem.

## Creational Patterns 
Creation of objects and classes

### Abstract Factory
Abstract Factory, Creates an instance of several families of classes

### Builder
Separates object construction from its representation

### Factory Method
Creates an instance of several derived classes

### Prototype
A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned

### Singleton - //LD_SINGLETON
A class of which only a single instance can exist

## Structural Patterns
Class and Object Composition

### Adapter
Match interfaces of different classes

### Bridge
Separates an object’s interface from its implementation

### Composite
A tree structure of simple and composite objects

### Decorator
Add responsibilities to objects dynamically

### Facade
A single class that represents an entire subsystem

### Flyweight
A fine-grained instance used for efficient sharing

### Proxy
An object representing another object

## Behavioral Patterns
Communication between class and objects

### Chain of Responsability
A way of passing a request between a chain of objects

### Command
Encapsulate a command request as an object

### Interpreter
A way to include language elements in a program

### Iterator
Sequentially access the elements of a collection

### Mediator
Defines simplified communication between classes

### Memento
Capture and restore an object's internal state

### Observer
A way of notifying change to a number of classes

### State
Alter an object's behavior when its state changes

### Strategy
Encapsulates an algorithm inside a class

### Template Method
Method	Defer the exact steps of an algorithm to a subclass

### Visitor
Defines a new operation to a class without change
