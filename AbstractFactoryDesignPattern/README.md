[Creational] Abstract Factory Design Pattern:

The abstract factory design pattern is merely an extension of the factory method pattern, 
which allows you to create(by an interface) objects without specifying the actual class of the 
objects being produced. The abstract factory pattern extends the factory method pattern 
4 by allowing more types of objects to be produced.
