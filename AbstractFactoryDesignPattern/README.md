# Abstract Factory
### Creational - Abstract Factory

Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

Abstract Factory is merely an extension of the factory method pattern, which allows to create objects without being concerned about the actual class of the objects being produced. 

The abstract factory pattern extends the factory method pattern by allowing more types of objects to be produced.
